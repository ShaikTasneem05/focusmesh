# 🧠 FocusMesh — A Cognitive-Aware Focus Companion

FocusMesh is a **privacy-first, cognitive-aware browser extension** designed to prevent mental spiraling, reduce digital overload, and help students and professionals maintain **deep, sustainable focus**.

Instead of blocking the internet or forcing productivity, FocusMesh gently **understands intent**, detects early signs of cognitive overload, and nudges users back into clarity — all **locally on the device**.

---

## 🚨 The Problem

Modern digital work creates:
- Endless tab-hopping
- Doom scrolling
- Cognitive overload
- Task fragmentation
- Burnout disguised as productivity

Traditional productivity tools:
- Block websites blindly
- Ignore mental state
- Break natural workflows
- Feel restrictive and stressful

**FocusMesh solves this differently.**

---

## 💡 Our Solution (What FocusMesh Does)

FocusMesh acts like a **digital cognitive partner**.

### 1️⃣ Single Active Task Mode
Users define **one primary task** (e.g., “Machine Learning Assignment”).

The extension:
- Continuously checks whether open tabs align with that task
- Flags irrelevant tabs visually (without blocking)
- Helps users stay aware, not controlled

---

### 2️⃣ Smart Tab Grouping (MVP)
With one click, users can:
- Group irrelevant tabs together
- Clean their workspace instantly
- Reduce visual and mental clutter

---

### 3️⃣ Cognitive Temperature Engine (MVP)
Using lightweight behavioral signals such as:
- Tab switching frequency
- Scroll activity
- Interaction rhythm

FocusMesh calculates a **Cognitive Temperature score**:
- 🟢 Low → calm focus
- 🟡 Medium → drifting
- 🔴 High → potential spiral

This helps detect overload **before burnout begins**.

---

### 4️⃣ Local Intent-Based Tab Analysis
* Reads **only visible page text**
* Matches content relevance to the active task
* Runs entirely **on-device**
* No browsing history stored
* No cloud processing

---

### 5️⃣ Privacy by Design
- ❌ No servers
- ❌ No user tracking
- ❌ No data sharing
- ✅ 100% local execution
- ✅ Full user control
